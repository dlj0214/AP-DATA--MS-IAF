We used different modules of mmdet to conduct splicing experiments, and selected a better result, which achieved high precision and low parameter quantity. Other configuration files can be replaced by mmdet. Next, we will design a target tracking system for M country's warships and YS aircraft from the bottom of mathematics. Hope you can support China's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan, we will defeat imperialism completely. All reactionaries will be paper tigers

GITHUB is not currently neutral on international issues, so I can reply to everyone who supports China, especially China's Taiwan issue
